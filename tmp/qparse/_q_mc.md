There is **NO** explanation here ...!


# Yes/No
Will the following code print anything?

```python
for n in range(10):
    if n > 9:
        print('Hello, world!')
```

A hint would be `select one of these`{
#dropdown
.abort
choices='a. args|b. blah |c. crash' 
answers='0,1'
}.

Another hint `fill-in the blank`{
#fill-in
answer='a'
}

a. Yes
b. No

tags: python
section: programming
answer: b
explanation:
`n` is in range \[0, 10), excluding the right limit, so its maximum value
is 9.  So nothing is printed.
